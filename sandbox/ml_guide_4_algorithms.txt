File 4: Common Algorithms for Beginners

- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).
- Logistic Regression: For binary classification (e.g., yes/no predictions).
- Decision Trees: Splits data based on feature values.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on nearest data points.

These algorithms are simple and widely used for learning ML basics.
