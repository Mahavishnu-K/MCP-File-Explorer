File 2: Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Trained on labeled data (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not).
2. Unsupervised Learning: Trained on unlabeled data (e.g., grouping customers by behaviors).
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns via trial and error, receiving feedback (e.g., robotics, game-playing).
